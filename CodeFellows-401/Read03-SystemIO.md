All I can really say about this is: YEEEEESSSSS. I love getting into reading from and writing to/creating new files on the client machine. I did quite of a a bit of this in Java, but didn't do much with in Objective-C, Python, C++, my previous slight experience with C#. Then of course in JavaScript you *can't* directly read/write data on the server itself (you can with AJAX, but I did very little with AJAX directly).

Certainly working with the read/write streams, and the various class methods of File, the various concrete subclasses of Stream, and all the other options in the .NET Framework will be a little odd and challenging, but I am seriously looking forward to this. I'm also curious if it's possible to asynchronously write multiple lines, in order, to a file. I'm also curious how in the .NET Framework you can notify when an code block finishes.

The third article would indicate that we're going to be doing something with writing and/or reading binary data, which is even more exciting.
