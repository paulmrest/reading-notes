# Read 02: Unit Tests & Documentation

## [You Still Don’t Know How to Do Unit Testing (and Your Secret is Safe with Me)](https://stackify.com/unit-testing-basics-best-practices/)
## [xUnit.net Documentation](https://xunit.github.io/#documentation)

Unit testing is one of those topics I've heard about for years, and never really bothered to look into. Now, thanks to the Stackify article, I know *basically* what it means. That said, I found the examples in that article pretty disapointing... I want to see something a little more realisitc than testing a method in a single-method class.

So yeah, unit testing is the practice of breaking down what your code is supposed to do into discrete units, and testing those units. Tests shouldn't rely on each other, and should do their own setup and cleanup. One test per test method, becauser otherwise you need to track down why that particualr test failed. It seems like the `Assert` is the main way of testing, although I do wonder if there are others.

xUnit looks interesting. I really only skimmed a few of the articles, including the Getting Started for the .NET Framework/Visual Studio, as I imagine that this is what we'll be using in the class. To really get this, I'll need to dive into actually using it.

## [Readme Best Practices](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices)

This one I really just ran out of steam on tonight.

That said, READMEs are something I've struggled with, so I've bookmarked both of these will be reading them tomorrow or the next day. When creating a README.
