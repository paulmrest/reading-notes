# Read 42 - Ethics

There is obviously way too much here to respond to every article linked (there's too much to even include the links above, as I normally do).

Instead, I'll just respond to a couple of things that stood out to me:

1. Self Driving Cars

The most surprising thing here is that there is *nothing* that mentions [the death of Elaine Herzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg). One article is literally from a month and a half before.

To put it simply, there is a reason we don't live in a world with self-driving cars here in 2020. A good summary: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/business/self-driving-autonomous-cars.html. The technology just isn't there yet, and honestly may never be unless we can develop true AI (not machine learning or neural nets that can write Mozart-ish classical music). The ethical considerations the linked articles go into (really just a version of the Trolly Problem, only with the additional complexity of not being able to excuse the action chosen because the operator/driver did it in the "heat of the moment") is one of the core issues, but there are certainly others.

In all likelihood, self-driving cars will, for a while yet anyway, be used in limited applications (on corporate campuses, or in other similarly closed and isolated systems).

1. This [awful article](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

"BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT"

Uh, no, it won't. You know why? Because our generations' civil rights issue is CIVIL RIGHTS. I tried to look into who this writer is, but couldn't find anything.

Big data is certainly important, and has a huge amount of impact, but nothing as concrete as the civil rights issues we've been seeing growing worldwide for years now, particularly in 2020. And honestly, the problems with big data are the same problems around all tech: try to think through how what you're building will impact the world, and if you decide to release that product into the world, KEEP LOOKING AFTERWARD. Keep evaluating how what you've built is impacting the world, both in the ways you expected, and otherwise.
