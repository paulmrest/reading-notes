# Read 09 - Refactoring

## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

Functional programming is another one of those topics I've known about in principle for a while, and haven't really explored much. So I'm looking forward to whatever depth we go into this. The basic tenant, which I knew before and this article reiterates, is that functions should only change things within the scope of the function, rather than altering primitives/objects passed by reference.

ALthough I dislike the article calling functional functions "pure", as that word certainly has connotations that should be left out of software development.

I didn't get much out of this, other than the point that you should think through your logic and try to future-proof it as much as possible.

It felt like the issues they were solving here weren't really around readability, but more handling edge cases and anticipating that functions can balloon in size.
