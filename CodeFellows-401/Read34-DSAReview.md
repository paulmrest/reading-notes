# Read 34 - DSA Review

Well, it's almost 1 AM and I've been working about 14 - 15 hours today. So no, I'm not going to be able to look at a data structure or algorithm that I struggled with.

That said, I know exactly which one I need to do this with: Quick Sort. For whatever reason, while Insertion Sort and Merge Sort both make intuitive sense to me, Quick Sort is more of a stretch.

When doing my "blog" I had to implement the solution, and step through the sample input to clear things up. I kept getting confused about what was supposed to happen where and how.

I think the best way for me to approach this will be to just drill myself. Write a Quick Sort over and over, and each time get through as much of it as possible without checking a pre-existing implementation. I don't write an algorithm from rote memory; I always need to understand what is happening and why.

Obviously that's going to take time, and it's not something I'm going to start now. Now is time for sleep.
