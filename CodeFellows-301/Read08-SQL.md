# Read 08 - SQL

It's late enough and I've still got other things to do that I'm just putting this in as a filler. Hopefully I'll be able to look at this more in-depth tomorrow.

I skimmed the materials, but I've worked with SQL a decent amount before. Mostly select, update, insert, and delete queries, but also working with building and deleting temp tables. Although all of that was using T-SQL in SQL Server Management Studio, which is likely a very different environment from what we'll be doing.

I did struggle with having a deep understanding the various joins, and would often end up experimenting to find the one that gave me the data I wanted. I am hoping that this approach will give me a chance to get a better grasp of that.

I also always struggled with SQL queries being set-based. I want to loop over data, not apply operators to a set of data! SQL does have a cursor that you can use to loop over data, but it's generally ill-advised and inefficent.
