Most of the subject matter in the above articles are things I'm quite, or at least decently, familiar with.

That said, during today's lab I did realize I am a little more rusty than I thought I'd be in some areas. I had to look up abstract vs virtual. I also had to double-check my high-level understanding of abstraction and encapsulation. So I'm looking forward to getting to use this stuff again, as it's been a few years, and really get a deep understanding.

Additionally, most of my OOP knowledge comes from looking things up on my own (whether out of pure curiosity or while trying to implement something in a personal software project), and I know my maximum retention comes when I explain it to someone else, or at least discuss it. So getting to work on labs, code challenges, whiteboards, and projects while discussing OOP principles with my classmates, TAs, and the instructor will, I am sure, cement that knowledge set far more than previously.

Reading through the above articles, there are a few things to note:

- Sealed classes: I am not even sure the other OOP languages I work in have this. That you can prevent inheritance from a class seems like an interesting functionality I'd like to see a real-world-application for.
- Anonymous types: I have done something similar in Java (I believe they're called anonymous classes there), but this just always tickled me.
- Generics: I've mentioned is previously...I am really looking forward to learning about generics and implementing them.
