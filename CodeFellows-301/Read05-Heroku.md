# Read 05 - Heroku Deployment

## [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
## Up Through "Deploy the app"

I actually did this during the pre-work: https://polar-tundra-27828.herokuapp.com/. I went further, up until/through "Provision a database", although some parts of the last section lost.

Heroku is another of those things that I understand in principle, but really want to see more in practice before I feel like I "get it". To that end, I attempted to run through the other link in today's assignment ([Node.js For Beginners. Deploy Your Blog to Heroku](https://howtonode.org/deploy-blog-to-heroku)) but only got as far as trying to access my "blog" locally. I got a 404 error there, and I'm not sure why. That page lists three different JS files, but the instructions don't say what code goes in which file, and the code sample links are broken.

I did find freeCodeCamp's [How to deploy a Node Application and Database to Heroku](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-node-application-and-database-to-heroku/) which looks like a good substitute. If I have more time later today or over the weekend, I may run through that.
