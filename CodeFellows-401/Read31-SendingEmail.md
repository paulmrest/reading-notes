# Read 30 - Sending Email

## [How to Send Email Using SendGrid with Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sendgrid-dotnet-how-to-send-email)

Ha, well, I already did most of this for the [VROOM](https://github.com/NaamaBarIlan/VROOM) project when we added SendGrid.

The thing that really surprised me about SendGrid was just how easy it was. Getting the point where we could send outgoing emails took maybe 30 minutes, and it seemed to work great for our limited use-case.

I do notice that it has some more advanced capabilities like attachments and analytics. I doubt we'll get into analytics, but I'd bet we'll do attachments... which looks pretty easy too.

Yay for well designed packages!
