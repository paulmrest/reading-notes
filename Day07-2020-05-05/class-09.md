## Chapter 7 - Forms

**Forms** in HTML offer a way of gathering information a site is asking from a user into a single unit. Elements within a form can include textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop down lists, and buttons. Information from form elements is sent to a server as **name/value** pairs.

```HTML
<form action="https//www.server.com/coolapp.php">
  <input type="text" name="username"/>
</form>
```

In the above example, we are putting a text box on the page, and when whatever a user has entered in the textbox is sent submitted, it is sent to https://www.server.com/coolapp.php with the name/value pair "username/USER ENTERED TEXT".

Form elements also allow for validation with attributs like `maxLength`.
