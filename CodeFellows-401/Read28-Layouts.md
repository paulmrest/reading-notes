The only thing here that felt new is layouts and partial views, both of which feel similar to EJS partials in Node.js, only with some MVVM goodness thrown in. We've already (on 8/10 and 8/11) worked with views and tag helpers.

Partially I'm sure its sleep deprivation (2 nights in a row of working until after 1 am...), but I just keep seeing "oh, yeah, it's like EJS partials...". Yeah, it's based off a certain file structure and specified file names, but EJS is also all about file names and file structure to some degree.
