## [Deliberate Practice — The Fastest Way to Improve Your Skills](https://medium.com/@hamre_erik/deliberate-practice-the-fastest-way-to-improve-your-skills-c98c32521dee)

This brings to mind my earlier attempt at learning .NET/C#, where I took some Udemy online classes, learned the basics, and then set out 
to actually build something. I immediately ran into the issue that trying to build a GUI on my old MacBook required Xamarin, and Xamarin
did not play well with Xcode and the macOS version of Visual Studio. I spent a few weeks fighting with it, trying to get some basic
functionality like buttons and windows working, and finally gave up. As I couldn't build anything that wasn't just a console program (and I've built plenty of those), I couldn't push my knowledge of the platform.

Compared to my experience with learning Cocoa/Objective-C, where I did something similar but then could dive in and build something that challenged me again and again, while constantly building on my knowledge (CoreData, CoreAnimation, the complexities of MVC, delegates, protocols, etc...). While certainly not mastery level, my knowledge of the Xcode development environment, and how to build an iOS app in Cocoa/Objective-C was gained through struggle and continuously building on my previous knowledge.

This article and video pretty much talks about this: challenging yourself and building on your previous knowledge to continuously expand the scope of your capabilities and knowledge. Computer science is, from the perspective of a single human lifetime, an infinitely complex subject, and there is always something new to learn, something new to master. And that's not even counting all the new topics and knowledge being continuously added.

One thing that frustrates me about articles like this is they are very much written for the white-collar worker with little to no domestic obligation. This article doesn't even *acknowledge* the difficulty of that kind of continuous learning when you're raising a family, taking care of relatives, or have the kinds of obligations that people have. This is of course an illusion granted to men, specifically white men, in our society as the vast majority of those domestic labors have been done behind the scenes by others. It is telling that his is an article written by a white male, talking about a book written by a white male.


## [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)

I liked the "not yet" grade idea mentioned here. Having permission, and space, to fail, even in an academic environment, contributes to a student's ability to absorb the lessons from a failure, and carry on learning that topic. Dweck using actual scientific data here to back up this idea (not that I doubted it... if my life has taught me anything its the value of pushing yourself) was also interesting, although I'd like to see more on that.

I also liked that Dweck spent the last half of the video talking about inequality, despite the solutions discussed are minimal in the face of the kind of systemic oppression built into our society. That said, every little bit counts.


## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)

I was already familiar with Angela Duckworth (her new podcast with Stephen Dubner, [No Stupid Questions](https://freakonomics.com/nsq/), is phenomenal) and her ideas on grit. This video talks about grit's importance, and ties it into Growth Mindset. I like Duckworth's quote from this video: "Grit is living life like it's marathon, not a sprint". So much of our culture's value around accomplishments is in those that happen quickly: geniuses who can understand something in moments, athletes who have a "natural" ability, overnight millionaires, and so on. Of course so many of those "quick" accomplishments are actually the result of years of grit, but often our culture overlooks how important all of that is.


## [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

This was quite interesting. I certainly have suffered from a degree of shame around my former professional positions, not wanting to tell people what I did because it felt inadequate to who I thought I could be, so his talk of snobbery around people's job titles reminded me that it was only my own perception of other's snobbery that gave me that shame.

The most important message here is that there is far more to success or failure than personal agency. Yes, effort does have an effect, but for various systemic reasons, there will always be those who are less successful, on whatever scale you want to consider that. The idea that in a meritocracy those who end up on the bottom get "exactly what they deserve" is a simple follow-through of the ideals of a system, and not something that should be considered an acceptable outcome.


## [The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome - Pt 1](https://soundcloud.com/drssarahcare/self-care-with-drs-sarah-impostor-syndrome-part-i)
## [The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome - Pt 2](https://soundcloud.com/drssarahcare/self-care-with-drs-sarah-the-impostor-syndrome-part-ii)

The main point here is that while impostor syndrome can affect anyone, it is the most prevalent with people from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who have followed a less traditional path to wherever they are. Also, that impostor syndrome can be actively mitigated through systemic structures.

One thing I did think of listening to the above episodes: I am grateful that Code Fellows actively tries to make everyone feel included and capable. While when taking on a topic as complex as programming, and learning how to move into a field as competitive as software development, is likely to induce some impostor syndrome in most people, there's little to no snootiness, even from other students, at different people's backgrounds. This stands in stark contrast to the kind of academic "click" of an institution like Harvard.


## [How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

Solving any complex problem is difficult for most people the majority of the time. Unless you've worked a similar problem, even getting to a point of understanding the problem is a process. Then actually solving the problem is a whole other process, sometimes even more involved.

This article tries to break those processes down. Read the problem deeply. Diagram it. Talk about it. Give yourself time to understand it. Reduce the problem into more elemental chunks and try to solve those. If you can't solve the more elemental chunks, see if they can be broken down more. If not, figure out a simpler version of whatever chunk you're working on, solve that, and then work your way back to the actual chunk. If all else fails, ask someone or search for an answer to a specific chunk.

One thing this article does not mention but I've found to be true: solving one element of a larger problem will frequently facilitate understanding and a solution to other elements and even the larger problem. Most problems aren't an arbitrary collection of steps, but rather how to get from State A (less desirable) to State B (more desirable), and those elementary chunks have a kind of rhyming poetry with each other.

Finally, I would disagree that looking up the answer to the larger problem is a bad idea, as long as you're willing to put in the work to recreate the solution yourself and understand it thoroughly.


## [Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

I found this article to be about 90 - 95% garbage. Just the concept of "what if your time was worth a ZILLION GAJILLION BILLION DOLLARS?" is so utterly misguided I don't even know where to begin.

So I'm going to pivot away from the trash examples this article uses and talk about what this wannabe self-help author is trying to get at: choosing how to spend your time in a way that is meaningful to you. This, which the article utterly fails to recognize, is a privilege. One frequently afforded to affluent men who have heaps of privilege and don't recognize it. But within a person's own power to choose how they spend their time, there is intentionality and agency to be found. Humans have, once you strip away sophomoric meditations on the deterministic nature of Classical Newtonian Physics, free will. With every choice we make we create one new reality, and destroy an infinity of unrealized realities. So given a person's station, their freedoms, their ability to choose (which, again, is going to vary MASSIVELY depending on a person's situation), a person can always ask themselves: is what I'm choosing going to have a positive impact on my future self? Is there something else that might have an even larger positive impact?

If the best way for you to spend what little free time you have is to re-watch your favorite episode of "garbage TV", or some other "low quality activity", then yes, please do. Nobody gets to tell you that's not the case, regardless of how many generic stock photos they put into their article of attractive people being happy and productive. But at the same time, I think everyone has fallen into traps of doing something that feels good because it is easy and habit, when there could be something better, even if it is starting a new "garbage TV" show.

The more I think about it and re-read this, the more offensive I find this article. Ugh. And then I made the mistake of clicking on the author's name and seeing the other "articles" they've written. I feel like I need to re-watch and episode of something human to cleanse my palate.


## [What I Wish I Knew Before I Learned to Code](https://medium.com/coding-in-simple-english/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-learned-to-code-8edcadbd2dcd)

This is so much better than the GAZILLION DOLLARS article I just talked about; I wish I had more to say about it.

This is mostly rehashing the same topics that Code Fellows has been talking about since 102: learning is an ever-ongoing process, and everyone starts from different places learning the same topic, and brings different abilities and skillsets.

One thing I will note is that I learned a few things about my own learning style in 301: namely how important it is for me to actually implement whatever it is I'm learning. I need to build it to understand and see how the pieces fit together, even if I already understand 90% of the pieces.
