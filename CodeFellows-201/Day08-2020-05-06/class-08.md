I'm going to go over the items that strike me re-reading this:

Floats: this is definitely something I've struggled with so far. I think what I keep forgetting is that when the float property is applied to a given element, it floats *all* the subsequent elements within the element's container.

Clearing Floats: I think I understand this from lecture, but the book's description seems odd and unclear to me. Not sure "no element should touch the left or right hand sides of the box" dovetails in with my understanding. Likely need more clarification on this.

Multi-Column Layouts with Floats: I can see a lot of potential here with my Salmon Cookies main site.
