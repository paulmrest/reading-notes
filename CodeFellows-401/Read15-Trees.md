# Read 15 - Trees

## [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)

Trees are one of those topics I love using, although I've not gotten to actually implement them in a useful way yet. I get that trees are used for a lot of data structures that are needing to insert and remove data constantly, and I get why: the efficiency of searching through a tree is very good, generally O(n) as a worse case. So perhaps getting to actually use a tree as we move deeper into this class is exciting.

Also, I do love recursion. *Any* excuse to use recursion and I'll try it, although I've found during 301 and 401 that I'm definitely rusty with my ability to implement a recursive algorithm. I am sure we'll be using recursion to navigate our trees here, and I'm looking forward to the chance to brush up on my recursion skills.

I did some additional research outside of this article around what applications of trees are, and found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2200588/2149946. I had no idea that trees were used for heaps, P2P file sharing, nor that they are used in every router for router-tables.
