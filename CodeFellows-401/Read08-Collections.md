Collections are where you start getting into interesting data structures. Lists and Dictionaries are both collection types I frequently want to use, even when I'm not allowed to as they're not in scope yet (and I don't always follow that for Lists...).

I've never built something where I found a use for Queues for Stacks, but I'm curious to see what kinds of things they can be used for.

I'm also looking forward to, hopefully, learning about implementing our own classes that use `ICompare<T>` soon.

More than anything that's mentioned here, the thing I am most looking forward to is learning about LINQ. So many questions of the nature "how do I do x in C#?" spew out answers from Google along lines of "just use LINQ! So much easier!".

I'm also excited about getting to use Enums. They can be a great way of organizing small chunks of data, and providing options for our classes.
