I read over/skimmed over all of these last night, and skipped around in the video (I didn't honestly have time to watch the full hour).

All the foundational aspects of this make sense. Both from what I learned in 301 around building APIs, and my prior experience with MVC (in terms of adding model classes and controllers and whatnot). But for me, I need to actually get in there and start building this stuff to really have this make sense.

Visual Studio, like Xcode, is a big, complicated IDE. A project has all kinds of configurations and dependencies that will, I'm sure, feel like magic incantations to some degree until a few days into working with this stuff where the various pieces will all come together.

One thing that didn't make total sense from the provided links is the Razor Pages. I can see that it's basically HTML with some added tags that access model data, but the actual connection between those entities doesn't entirely make sense to me yet. It does remind of what Amanda was talking about on Monday, 7/20, when I was asking about the connection between the Model and the View in MS's ASP.NET Core tutorial videos from yesterday. I'm sure all this will make more sense in a few days.

User secrets in Visual Studio seem very similar to using an environmental file in an ExpressJS server, just with a different syntax (well, the secrets file itself is JSON).
