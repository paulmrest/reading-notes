Not a lot to say here either. Sean introduced me to EJS partials earlier today, and we used them when building our client-side HTML using EJS for the header (nav bar and their ilk), and what we had of a footer.

I will say that it's definitely a useful, and fairly powerful functionality when it comes to having DRY code. Not having to repeat the same header, footer, or any other modular HTML code in EJS would be, especially for larger sites, incredibly useful.
