# Code Fellows - Reading Notes

**Hi There!**

My name is Paul and I've been dabbling in coding since 2011. In 2015 I managed to complete an iOS app and got it published to the App Store:

I have completed Code Fellow's 102 and 201 class, am presently enrolled in 301, and am scheduled to complete 401 on 9/11/2020. I am looking forward to finally learning to be a full stack developer and get my career in software dev underway.

Outside of development and computer science in general, I enjoy reading and writing, and the great outdoors of the Pacific Northwest (bicycling for commuting and sport, hiking, skiing, etc...). I also have a deep abiding love of astronomy and astrophysics, and someday would like to get back into amateur astronomy (the light pollution of Pugetopolis made my light bucket of a telescope rather useless).

One of the most enjoyable things about Software Development for me is the complexity with which different systems interact with each other:
