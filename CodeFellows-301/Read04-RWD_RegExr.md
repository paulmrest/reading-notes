This is definitely one of those "I'll need to actually use it to understand it" things. The CSS Garden Grid made sense up until about 22 out of the 28 lessons, and then it turned into trial and error for me.

CSS-Trick's website will, I'm sure, be incredibly useful once I build something using CSS Grid Layout.

I can see how powerful Grid Layout is for RWD, both from the Responsive Web Design with CSS Grid article and just thinking through the challenages of RWD and capabilities of Grid Layout.

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are one of those things I've encountered multiple times over the years and have always *meant* to get around to really diving into. I keep hearing how powerful and flexible they are. These items today helped some, but I still don't really get *why* regular expressions are so powerful. Mostly I've just used them when doing things like finding and/or replacing substrings, but I have the feeling that such uses are barely scratching the surface.

So I'm really looking forward to actually getting to sink my teeth into regular expressions in the next couple of days. I am sure the above links will be incredibly useful (especially Regex 101) once we start using them in earnest.

I did find it interesting how much apparent overlap there is in regular expressions. For example, it looks like `\abc+` and `\abc{1,}` do the same thing.
