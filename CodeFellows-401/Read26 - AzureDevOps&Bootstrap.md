# Read 26 - Azure Dev Ops & Bootstrap

## [Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops)

Azure DevOps really just sounds like GitHub (or any of the other git-based project distributed software project management services) with more powerful deployment capabilities built in (well, to my knowledge, the only thing GitHub has is GitHub Pages). They also seem to have some default documentation functionalities that sound useful.

Azure Pipelines sounds interesting, although I'm honestly not completely clear what it is... they really love throwing around continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI! and CD!), but they don't really explain it well. I mean, I get the basics: it's a way of deploying code such that others can have access to the runnable app. I'm assuming web apps? But maybe other kinds?

Bootstrap is another of those "I'll really have to actually use it to get it" things.

I have used Bootstrap in the past, maybe five years ago when I took on Free Code Academy's curriculum. It seemed pretty intuitive and powerful then: build up the right combination of classes and other attributes in your HTML elements, and boom, you have a pretty good looking site. I also understand it has some powerful functionalities around integrating with jQuery, which the second link talks about a little. Although it looks about as you'd expect considering Bootstrap is largely built around classes, and jQuery is a semantically clean and simple way to manipulate HTML elements from their classes.

One thing that did jump out at me: asynchronous functions and transitions. I noticed when working with CSS animations for my 201 project that they could be asynchronous, and was curious how, but never got around to diving into in more detail.
