Another one that feels like review for what we did on 6/16 in our class and lab. As I'm writing this after the lecture on 6/17, I feel like one thing we were supposed to get out of this was that HTTP only has the GET and POST, although I failed to notice that it lacks a method attribute for PUT or DELETE last night.

One thing I did notice last night, and may employ in future labs and assignments, is that you can view the HTTP request in the dev tools! I've used Fiddler for HTTP traffic monitoring, and WireShark for packet sniffing, but I actually didn't realize before reading this that you can view the request right in the dev tools (even though it makes total sense that they'd include such a functionality).
