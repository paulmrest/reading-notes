# Growth Mindset

The core of growth mindset, for me, is a rejection of the idea that skills, capabilities, and capacities are static, or even *that* difficult to change. With motivation and validation (positive reinforcement), anyone can buid any skillset, and expand both their capabilities and capacities.

For myself, I three reminders I need to stay in a growth mindset:
* Permission to be bad at something at first.
* Seek help and guidance from others.
* Find motivation in other's success.
