# Read 06 - Review of Week 01

The two big things I have a better grasp of compared to a week ago are:

- TDD: what unit tests were, and writing them, were both mostly foreign to me a week ago. I had some, very basic, understanding of "unit testing" as "testing very small parts of your code in discrete units", but beyond that, nada. I'm sure we've only scratched the surface of unit testing and TDD, but I do feel like I have a solid understanding now of it. Creating the tests still feels incredibly time consuming and tedious to me, but I imagine that will change as I get more used to it (or maybe there's shortcuts!).

- READMEs: in 201 and 301 we weren't really taught to create complete READMEs. We just kind of slapped some info on a markdown file and called it the "README". Now I feel like I have a decent basic understanding of how to build and format a README that doesn't bring shame to myself, my ancestors, and my descendants.
