# Read 35 - DSA Review

[Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

Graphs follow in HashTables and HashSets as being a data structure I've not used yet. This definitely is the most complicated DS we've touched on so far. Also, I don't have a clear idea of how you use a graph to accomplish any of the "Real World Uses" mentioned here.

I feel like I have an inkling. I bet a lot of them involve weighted graphs.

Also, Adjacency Matrices kind of melted my brain for about 90 seconds. I had to re-read that three times to actually get it. But then... why? Why would you represent a graph this way?

Last but not least, I don't feel like I understand how graphs are implemented (without using an Adjacency Matrix or List). The pseudo code shown here doesn't seem to really show how the nodes are connected. Also, is there a limit to how many nodes a given node to be connected to for the different types of graphs? How about directed vs undirected graphs?

Well, here's hoping tomorrow clears up most of this! Excited. A little confused and a lot of tired, but excited.
