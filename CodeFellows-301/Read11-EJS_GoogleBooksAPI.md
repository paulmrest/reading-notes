# Read 11 - EJS (and Google Books API)

## EJS:
### [WalkThroughCode's Intro to EJS Videos 1 - 5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7sCSgsRZ-slYARh3YJIqPGZqtGVqZRGt)
### [EJS Documentation](https://ejs.co/)
### [Templating with EJS](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application)

I found all the above materials pretty lacking. None of them gave a clear, simple, answer to the question: what is EJS and why do I want to learn how to use it?

So I did some additional research and found a better introduction: [Use EJS as Template Engine in Node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-ejs-as-template-engine-in-node-js/)

Once I got the basics (EJS is a Node.js library that allows the server to build HTML on the client-side website), the possibilities and potential became clear to me. This is definitely another of those topics where I'm going to need to actually dive into using it to really have a solid grasp of it, but I can certainly see a lot of potential.

## [Google Books API - Volumes Section](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes)

I don't have a lot to say about this. The API looks pretty similar to what we've already used, particularly Yelp. I'm sure we'll do something with pagination where we'll use the API's `startIndex` and `maxResults` request parameters.

Other than that, I'll just say that I like the look of Google's API documentation. It certainly seems a lot clearer than Yelp's.
