This is one of those things where I read the summary of what it *can* do and think "neat!" But then, at 11 PM at night, after working for over 12 hours, trying to read the MS documentation, or even the other link, and it just kind of fades into obscurity. If I had to, right now, I could sit down, fire up a project and implement this, and likely have a much better understanding of it.

So for now, it's "like EJS partials, only better!".

But I'm sure we'll be doing more or less the same thing tomorrow.

That said, I am about 90% sure we'll be using this for implementing a shopping cart feature. Not sure anyone would want to take that bet though...
